Effective management of waste is a
pressing global concern, and innovative
solutions are essential to address this
challenge. In this study, we propose a novel
approach for garbage detection using
drones equipped with the You Only Look
Once (YOLO) object detection model.
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a
dynamic and versatile platform for
monitoring vast and challenging terrains,
making them ideal for efficient waste
detection.
Our research leverages the YOLOv5 and v8
model's real-time object detection
capabilities to identify and classify different
types of garbage within various
environmental contexts. We present the
development and integration of a
specialized YOLO model for detecting
waste items, including plastics, metals,
paper, and other materials. The
YOLO-based model not only accurately
locates garbage enabling effective waste
management strategies.
We conducted extensive tests in diverse
environmental settings to evaluate the
performance of our system. The results
indicate that the YOLO-v_ and v_ based
drone system achieves high precision and
recall rates in garbage detection, even in
challenging conditions such as densely
vegetated areas and urban landscapes. The
real-time feedback provided by the system
enables rapid decision-making for waste
collection and removal.
Our approach holds the potential to
significantly enhance waste management
processes, reduce environmental pollution,
and optimize resource allocation. The
combination of drone technology and the
YOLO model not only improves the
efficiency of garbage detection but also
contributes to the preservation of natural
ecosystems and the overall well-being of
communities. As a result, this research
serves as a promising step toward a cleaner
and more sustainable future.
